# ITE - Integrated Toolset Environment

The goal is to create a stable set of packages which can work together,
leading your Sublime Text to be able to program/develop any language you ever need to.

Currently it is under heavy development.
Anyone interested in contributing,
can just do so by installing the development version of this project,
and then creating an awesome package for Sublime Text,
which can be used and is missing in this project.

You can check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/evandrocoan/ITE/issues) for a list of issues to be worked on.
Note,
there are several issues I already fixed,
but forgot to close.

## Installation <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#ite---integrated-toolset-environment)</sub></sub>

When following the installation steps,
you are going to be prompted to install either the Stable or Development version.
If you are planning to fix bugs and contribute to Sublime Text plugins development,
you should choose the Development installation.
But,
if you are only looking to use things and report bugs,
you can choose the Stable installation.

1. Download & Install `Sublime Text 3` (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Install the Sublime Text `Package Control` (https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
1. Go to the menu `Preferences -> Package Control`
1. Type `Package Control Add Channel` on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then, input the following address and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Now, go again to the menu `Preferences -> Package Control`
1. This time type `Package Control Install Package` on the opened quick panel and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. Then, search for `StudioChannel` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
1. After finished installing the `Studio Channel` package, just follow the instructions on the screen.


## Stable Installation <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#ite---integrated-toolset-environment)</sub></sub>

If you chose the Stable [Installation](#installation-go-to-top),
on this section you are going to be introduced with stable installation tips.

While installing the Stable version,
you can quickly edit any installed packages files by:
1. Opening the command palette and running the command `PackageResourceViewer:
   Extract All Packages`.
1. And setting the PackagesManager setting `"extract_everything": true`


### Using the Sublime Project <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#ite---integrated-toolset-environment)</sub></sub>

You can also open the `SublimeStudio.sublime-project` inside the `Packages/StudioChannel`
package (git submodule) to quickly view/edit all installed packages.
Just note,
if you are using the stable version and as all packages are distributed unpacked on the stable version,
all of your changes to the installed packages are going to be lost when they upgrade.
If you would like to save them after the upgrade,
you can use the `OverrideUnpackedPackages` feature.
See:
[OverrideUnpackedPackages](https://github.com/evandrocoan/OverrideUnpackedPackages) for more information.


### Adding to git <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#ite---integrated-toolset-environment)</sub></sub>

You can create a git repository on the root of your Stable Sublime Text installation by
using the following `.gitignore` file:
```sh
/.sublime/
/Backup/
/Cache/
/Index/
/KEEPME
/Local/
/Settings/

/Packages/User/FileHistory*.json
/Packages/User/PackagesManager.cache/*

**/.git/**
*.sublime-package
```
This should exclude most undesired/binary things and allow you to fiercely control
which changes happens with your Sublime Text Stable installation of the ITE.


## Development Installation <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#ite---integrated-toolset-environment)</sub></sub>

If you chose the Development [Installation](#installation-go-to-top),
on this section you are going to be introduced with development instructions/tips.

If you installed the development version,
you need to have installed on your system path variable the following programs:
1. git
1. curl (linux/cygwin)
1. wget (linux/cygwin)
1. zip (linux/cygwin)
1. unzip (linux/cygwin)
1. date (linux/cygwin)

Your git client need to have the user/login and password cached because some commands used
by some packages like the [Channel Manager](https://github.com/evandrocoan/channelmanager),
directly/unattended perform git operations like `git pull` and `git push`.
Then,
if your username or password is not cached,
these packages commands which do git operations,
are going to hang/block/not work properly.

To cache your git password you can use tools like:
1. https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows
1. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage


### `git clone` <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#ite---integrated-toolset-environment)</sub></sub>

It is not advised to use the `git --clone` command because git is buggy and cannot handle to clone this repository correctly.
By following the installation instructions just above,
you are going to be prompted whether you would like to install the `Stable` version or the `Development` version.
And choosing the `Development`,
this repository is going to programmatically and correctly be cloned by a Python Script.
So,
there is not need to directly use the `git clone` command.
But,
if you feel like manually using the `git clone` command,
you need to pass the `--recursive` option and use it like this:
```
git clone --recursive -j4 https://github.com/evandrocoan/ITE
```
The `-j4` parameter is to parallelly clone the repository using up to 4 threads or CPU cores.


### Sublimehq/Packages <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#ite---integrated-toolset-environment)</sub></sub>

Even if you choose to install the development version,
by the automated installer,
it will not install the default upstream for [Sublimehq/Packages](https://github.com/sublimehq/Packages).
For it, you can just run these commands:
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/evandroforks/Packages
mv Packages/.git "$SUBLIME_TEXT_DATA/Packages/.git"
```
Then,
you will need to open the directory `$SUBLIME_TEXT_DATA/Packages` as a usual git repository,
which is completely disconnected from the main ITE repository.
