   Settings](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2454292#post2454292)

This toolset is currently designed to be employed for development of the toolset itself. And
automatic updates are not available yet. Currently you need to check the upstream repositories for
updates manually. This is planned to be implemented on the next major version release. For more

# Development Installation

If you are using the portable version (Linux/Windows/Mac), rename/delete the folder `Data/` if it exists:

* The folder `Data/` contain all your **current settings**.

You can also open the command line on your Sublime Text folder using one of the following:
```
cd "%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages"             # On Windows
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3 # On Mac OS
cd ~/.config/sublime-text-3                        # On Linux
```


## Development install for Linux/Mac OS

Requirements for `Linux` systems are:

1. A shell terminal/command line available
1. Install `git` (https://git-scm.com/)
1. Install `rsync` (http://rsync.samba.org/)
1. Install `Sublime Text` (https://www.sublimetext.com/)

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git
    sudo apt-get install rsync
    sudo apt-get install sublime-text
    printf "Success\!\n"
    ```

### Steps

1. Open `Sublime Text`
1. Go to the menu: `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`. It should open your `Sublie Text` **Packages** folder:
1. Then open `a shell command line` on this folder.
1. Now close `Sublime Text` and run these commands:
    ```shell
    # This is the folder where all your `Sublime Text` settings/data is on.
    #
    # * If you are running the portable version of `Sublime Text`, replace `sublime-text-3` by `Data`
    # * If you are a Mac OS User, replace `sublime-text-3` by `Sublime Text 3`
    #
    sublime_text_folder="sublime-text-3"

    # Backup your settings and files, assuming the current folder is `Packages`
    cd ../..
    mv ./$sublime_text_folder/ ./"$sublime_text_folder"_backup_$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S')/
    mkdir ./$sublime_text_folder
    cd ./$sublime_text_folder

    # Download the required files
    git clone https://github.com/evandrocoan/Packages
    git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio

    # Configure the environment
    mkdir -p ./Packages
    shopt -s dotglob
    git submodule foreach git checkout master

    # To install the files
    mv ./SublimeTextStudio/Packages/* ./Packages
    rsync -a ./SublimeTextStudio/ ./
    rm -r -f ./SublimeTextStudio

    # Success
    printf "Success\\!\n"
    ```

After finish running all these commands, open `Sublime Text` and wait until the `Packages Control`
install all the packages:

* It should take some minutes until install all new packages, after that restart your `Sublime Text`.
* You can open the Console on `View -> Console (Ctrl+`) to view the download progress.
* This is a sample output of the full process on the command line: [Linux Command line output](https://gist.github.com/evandrocoan/60a1303ef5c0a6cb40c064ff27563020)

### Steps

1. Open `Sublime Text`
1. Go to the menu: `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`. It should open your `Sublie Text` **Packages** folder:
1. Then open `a command line` on this folder.
1. Run the command line `cmd /open`
1. Now close the Windows Explorer opened on the Packages folder.
1. And also close `Sublime Text` and run these commands bellow:
    ```batch
    :: This is the folder where all your `Sublime Text` settings/data is on.
    :: * If you are running the portable version of `Sublime Text`, replace `Sublime Text 3` by `Data`
    ::
    set sublime_text_folder=Sublime Text 3

    :: Backup your settings and files, assuming the current folder is `Packages`
    cd ..\..
    set "pp=%%"
    for /f "delims=" %pp:~-1%a in ('wmic OS Get localdatetime  ^| find "."') do set dt=%pp:~-1%a
    rename "%sublime_text_folder%" "%sublime_text_folder% Backup %dt:~8,2%-%dt:~10,2%-%dt:~12,2%"
    mkdir "%sublime_text_folder%"
    cd .\%sublime_text_folder%

    :: Download the required files
    git clone https://github.com/evandrocoan/Packages
    git clone --recursive -j8 https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio

    :: Configure the environment
    mkdir Packages
    git submodule foreach git checkout master

    :: To install the files
    robocopy /move /e .\SublimeTextStudio\Packages\ .\Packages\ /NFL /NDL /nc /ns
    robocopy /move /e .\SublimeTextStudio\ .\ /NFL /NDL /NJH /NJS /nc /ns /np

    :: Success
    echo "Success\\!\n"
    ```

After finish running all these commands, open `Sublime Text` and wait until the `Packages Control`
install all the packages:

* It should take some minutes until install all new packages, after that restart your `Sublime Text`.
* You can open the Console on `View -> Console (Ctrl+')` to view the download progress.
* You can also see this *old video* tutorial [How to the Install Sublime Studio](https://vid.me/ODYj).
* This is a sample output of the full process on the command line: [Windows Command line output](https://gist.github.com/evandrocoan/a2e69c01e1f2721e6772b73fff88ff3c)

# Disabled Packages

For an updated list of packages to not enable see the issue:

1. https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio/issues/50 Ignored packages to not enable!

For now on, do not enable the packages:
```
Anaconda
GotoLastEditEnhanced
SublimeCodeIntel
```

Currently the package `GotoLastEditEnhanced` is causing Sublime Text to bleedly leak memory and
crash after a few minutes of highly typing text. See the issues:

1. https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1846
1. https://github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-goto-last-edit-enhanced/issues/3

The package `SublimeCodeIntel` is heavily conflicting with the package `All Autocomplete` and
`Amxx Pawn`. Currently the package `SublimeCodeIntel` needs to be fixed to stop conflicting with
the other packages. Basically it is overriding all the others autocompletions. Issue:

1. https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeTextStudio/issues/41

The package `Anaconda` is conflicting with the package `Jedi - Python autocompletion` which seems a
better alternative to. But this still in study which package will be the better.

## Debugging

Use on the console: (View -> Show Console)
```
sublime.log_input(True); sublime.log_commands(True); sublime.log_result_regex(True)
```

To disable it do:
```
sublime.log_input(False); sublime.log_commands(False); sublime.log_result_regex(False)
```
