# Disabled Packages

For an updated list of packages to not enable see the issue:

1. https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeStudio/issues/50 Ignored packages to not enable!

For now on, do not enable the packages:
```
Anaconda
GotoLastEditEnhanced
SublimeCodeIntel
```

Currently the package `GotoLastEditEnhanced` is causing Sublime Text to bleedly leak memory and
crash after a few minutes of highly typing text. See the issues:

1. https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1846
1. https://github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-goto-last-edit-enhanced/issues/3

The package `SublimeCodeIntel` is heavily conflicting with the package `All Autocomplete` and
`Amxx Pawn`. Currently the package `SublimeCodeIntel` needs to be fixed to stop conflicting with
the other packages. Basically it is overriding all the others autocompletions. Issue:

1. https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeStudio/issues/41

The package `Anaconda` is conflicting with the package `Jedi - Python autocompletion` which seems a
better alternative to. But this still in study which package will be the better.

## Debugging

Use on the console: (View -> Show Console)
```
sublime.log_input(True); sublime.log_commands(True); sublime.log_result_regex(True)
```

To disable it do:
```
sublime.log_input(False); sublime.log_commands(False); sublime.log_result_regex(False)
```
