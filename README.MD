# ITE - Integrated Toolset Environment

The goal is to create a stable set of packages which can work together,
leading your Sublime Text to be able to program/develop any language you ever need to.

Currently it is under heavily development.
Anyone interested in contribute,
can just do so by installing the development version of this project,
and then creating a awesome package for Sublime Text,
which can be used and lacks on this project.

You can check our [issue tracker](https://github.com/evandrocoan/ITE/issues) for a list o issues to
be worked on.

## Installation <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#ite---integrated-toolset-environment)</sub></sub>

1. Download & Install `Sublime Text 3` (https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
1. Install the Sublime Text `Package Control` (https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
1. Go to the menu `Preferences -> Package Control`
1. Type `Add Channel` on the opened quick panel and press enter
1. Then enter the following address and press enter:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evandrocoan/StudioChannel/master/channel.json
   ```
1. Now, go again to the menu `Preferences -> Package Control`
1. This time type `Install Package` on the opened quick panel and press enter
1. Then search for `StudioChannel` and press enter
1. After finish installing the `Studio Channel` package, just follow the instructions on the screen.

### Extra

You can also open the `SublimeStudio.sublime-project` inside the `Packages/StudioChannel`
package (git submodule) to quickly view/edit all installed packages.
Just note,
if you are using the stable version and as all packages are distributed unpacked on the stable version,
all of your changes to the installed packages will be lost when they upgrade.
If you would like to save them after the upgrade,
you can use the `OverrideUnpackedPackages` feature.
See:
[OverrideUnpackedPackages](https://github.com/evandrocoan/OverrideUnpackedPackages) for more information.

### Development

If you installed or would like to install the development version,
you need to have installed on your system path variable the following programs:
1. git
1. curl (linux/cygwin)
1. wget (linux/cygwin)
1. zip (linux/cygwin)
1. unzip (linux/cygwin)
1. date (linux/cygwin)

You git client need to have the user/login and password cached because some commands used
by some packages like the [Channel Manager](https://github.com/evandrocoan/channelmanager),
directly/unattended perform git operations like `git pull` and `git push`.
Then,
if your username or password is not cached,
these packages commands which do git operations,
are going to hang/block/not work properly.

To cache your git password you can use tools like:
1. https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows
1. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage

## Disabled Packages <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#ite---integrated-toolset-environment)</sub></sub>

For an updated list of packages to not enable see the issue:

1. https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeStudio/issues/50 Ignored packages to not enable!

For now on, do not enable the packages:
```
Anaconda
GotoLastEditEnhanced
SublimeCodeIntel
```

Currently the package `GotoLastEditEnhanced` is causing Sublime Text to bleedly leak memory and
crash after a few minutes of highly typing text. See the issues:

1. https://github.com/SublimeTextIssues/Core/issues/1846
1. https://github.com/shagabutdinov/sublime-goto-last-edit-enhanced/issues/3

The package `SublimeCodeIntel` is heavily conflicting with the package `All Autocomplete` and
`Amxx Pawn`. Currently the package `SublimeCodeIntel` needs to be fixed to stop conflicting with
the other packages. Basically it is overriding all the others autocompletions. Issue:

1. https://github.com/evandrocoan/SublimeStudio/issues/41

The package `Anaconda` is conflicting with the package `Jedi - Python autocompletion` which seems a
better alternative to. But this still in study which package will be the better.

## Debugging <sub><sub>[Go to Top](#ite---integrated-toolset-environment)</sub></sub>

Use on the console: (View -> Show Console)
```
sublime.log_input(True); sublime.log_commands(True); sublime.log_result_regex(True); sublime.log_indexing(True);
```

To disable it do:
```
sublime.log_input(False); sublime.log_commands(False); sublime.log_result_regex(False); sublime.log_indexing(False);
```
